I know this is not the best looking or functional site out there. The reason I made this site is to learn Frontend, but I googled my way into completing the site but not learning it at all. Still, it works... sometimes. If you have any suggestions, feedback or new content that can be added to the site, feel free to contact me on Discord at: <ins>***venus#8797***</ins>.<br><br>

Also, shoutout to <ins>[kei.moe](https://kei.moe/)</ins> and <ins>[hiyorishiina.com](http://hiyorishiina.com/)</ins>, this site is inspired by these two.
