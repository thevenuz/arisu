After the the end-of-term ceremony was concluded, all students went to their respective classrooms for some last explanations before I left the classroom at immediately.<br><br>

That being said, with my impaired feet, I couldn’t move as fast as other people. I eventually reached my goal and waited for that person who seemingly was delayed.<br><br>

"What are you doing out here, Sakayanagi?"<br><br>

Mashima, who attended the farewell ceremony for the 3rd years, puzzlingly asked me as he came closer.<br><br>

"I’ve been waiting for you, Mashima-sensei"<br><br>

"…For me?"<br><br>

"Yes. You are about to meet Ayanokouji-kun and Chabashira-sensei in the reception room, am I correct?"<br><br>

"What do you mean?"<br><br>

Mashima-sensei wouldn’t admit it, at least on the surface.<br><br>

But I already know the finer details. From the time I gave Ayanokouji-kun my father’s phone number, I expected this to happen.<br><br>

"You must have gotten a message from Chairman Sakayanagi to meet Ayanokouji-kun. Chabashira-sensei should be present as well, I presume?"<br><br>

"How do you know that?"<br><br>

———————<br><br>

"I just know more about the situation than both you and Chabashira-sensei, that’s all."<br><br>

"Even if that’s true, your name wasn’t mentioned."<br><br>

"That’s because I’m taking part on the spur of the moment. Could you I accompany you?"<br><br>

"I sadly don’t have the permission to do so. It would become a problem were I to take you along."<br><br>

"I will just meet up with you later even if we went separately. So why don’t we just go together in the first place? I believe It will save you some time as well."<br><br>

Even if I didn’t get his permission to go together with him, I would visit the reception room alone.<br><br>

In other words, the conclusion would be the same anyway.<br><br>

"…Fine, since it looks like you already know about the circumstances."<br><br>

"Thank you very much."<br><br>

I turned around and took a step towards the reception room. He soon caught up to me.<br><br>

"What in the world are we going to discuss at this meeting?"<br><br>

"Something very, very interesting."<br><br>

I can predict some of the moves the Interim Chairman Tsukishiro may use in the future. I feel my boring days are getting more colourful just by imagining that. Following after Mashima, we walked into the reception room where Ayanokouji-kun is waiting.<br><br>

To enjoy my time with him. And to enjoy what’s about to come.<br><br>
