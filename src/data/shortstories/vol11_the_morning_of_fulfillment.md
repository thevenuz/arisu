I was deep at sleep.<br><br>

The appearances of myself when I was young, and of him was repeatedly projected within.<br><br>

A famous museum of that world. Even the exhibition objects made for an artistic spectacle I think. It was that grandeur, that sweet, and that madly affectionable.<br><br>

In a sense, that was love.<br><br>

There are many kinds of love.<br><br>

Love, charity, affection… love-and-hate.<br><br>

I think, I feel all of those towards him.<br><br>

"…3 hours and 36 minutes…"<br><br>

Each time I wake up, I always check how much time I’ve slept. If I don’t sleep for 7-8 hours, I don’t feel refreshed. That was because I was so excited last night that I couldn’t sleep.<br><br>

The body pillow I use to support my sleep every day didn’t seem to work that much.<br><br>

"Fufufu…"<br><br>

I let out a sweet laughter before I knew it.<br><br>

I have never experienced becoming this excited before so I couldn’t control my feelings.<br><br>

The more I tried to hold back the laughter, a smile appeared, so naturally, on my face.<br><br>

I can’t help it.<br><br>

I was exposed by the contradiction dwelling within myself right now.<br><br>

A me that would never lose to anyone.<br><br>

A him that maybe would teach me defeat.<br><br>

The conflicting feelings were clashing, going back and forth, neither side yielding.<br><br>

However, there will definitely be a conclusion.<br><br>

In other words, superiority and inferiority will be decided.<br><br>

Ah— how beautiful it is.<br><br>

I hugged my body pillow tightly and a pleasant drowsiness came over me.<br><br>

I was already napping, wanting to enjoy a passionate dance with him.<br><br>

That dream of mine was being interrupted by the cold sounds of the ringing sounds from my cellphone.<br><br>

"Was that Masumi…? She’s also a worrywart, right."<br><br>

I know. Let’s continue the rest of my dream later tonight.<br><br>

After I have settled it with him, made it clear as black and white.<br><br>

At my leisure.<br><br>
