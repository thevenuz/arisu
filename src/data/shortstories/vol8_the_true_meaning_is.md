That boy walking towards me did so while looking away.<br><br>

I could easily see that he was engaged in a pleasant chat with his friends and thus was neglecting what is in front of him.<br><br>

At this rate, we will collide.<br><br>

However, even someone with handicapped legs like me can still adjust my course sufficiently enough considering my positioning.<br><br>

But there are times when my legs would hurt and it's harder than usual to get them to move.<br><br>

And that happened to be now.<br><br>

That is why I had no choice but to choose the option of calling out to him.<br><br>

"Umm---please look out?".<br><br>

However my voice was drowned out by the boys' laughter.<br><br>

Disregarding the fact that I had worked out a measure to avoid them a second time, it was rendered ineffective.<br><br>

Since it's come to that, I don't feel like coming up with a third proposal.<br><br>

I made up my mind and braced for the conclusion that would follow shortly after.<br><br>

Sure enough, the boy did not notice me and his shoulder, with some force, hit me.<br><br>

I tried to endure it but there was no way it would go swimmingly and all I could manage was to sit down right there as though collapsing.<br><br>
"Sorry, sorry. Are you ok?".<br><br>

The name of the boy who noticed me for the first time after running into me was Yamauchi Haruki. A student of Class C.<br><br>

For the record, I do keep that information in mind but as far as I'm concerned, he's an insignificant existence.<br><br>

"Yes...no need for concern".<br><br>

I did not take the hand that was extended to me, rather, I used the wall to slowly get back up.<br><br>

"Then, umm, I'll be off?".<br><br>

Yamauchi-kun ended it with a single, non-serious apology.<br><br>

In a sense, you could say he's a pleasant boy.<br><br>

"Yes. Please don't concern yourself with me".<br><br>

As I replied politely like that, Yamauchi-kun immediately returned to chatting with his friends and walked off.<br><br>

"Really though, Sakayanagi-chan is cute but isn't she clumsy?".<br><br>

Despite not having taken much distance from me yet, without even knowing that he's being overheard, Yamauchi-kun left behind such words and disappeared.<br><br>

He probably didn't see all of it, but it appears Ayanokouji-kun too, has been observing my interaction with him.<br><br>

I ended up letting him see something unsightly.<br><br>

"Are you alright?".<br><br>

"Thank you for your concern but it's not a big deal".<br><br>

"I'll give Yamauchi an earful later".<br><br>

"It's not like he deliberately did it, I only fell once at most".<br><br>

However, now that I have fallen once, it also means I have gained the right to make him fall too.<br><br>

"Well then, please excuse me".<br><br>

Sooner or later, I'll have to deliver a special gift to him.<br><br>
