The 5th day of the special exam is fast approaching.<br><br>

But the only ones who felt time running fast are the strong students with lots of extra energy, or the ones like me who remained at the starting line.<br><br>

The physical and mental stress is generally felt throughout all classes. <br><br>

As long as they repeatedly throw theirselves into this harsh environment, bad injuries will definitely begin to appear at this stage.<br><br>

I clearly understand that from watching the people entering and leaving the harbour from the beach I’m at.<br><br>

«Oh my?»<br><br>

I notice someone approaching me and my cheeks softens.<br><br>

Without showing any signs of fatigue, he walks closer to me as usual.<br><br>

«Good day Ayanokouji-kun. It’s a rather hot day today, isn’t it?»<br><br>

«How are you?»<br><br>

He’s the same as always. There are many people who exhibit this kind of calmness. But as expected of him, a mere few days of living on this uninhabited island doesn’t mean a thing to him.<br><br>

«About as usual, considering it’s me. I’m having Ichinose-san and Shibata-kun do their best so I can’t say it’s been too indulging.»<br><br>

It doesn’t need to be said but….<br><br>

If I could move freely, I would gladly have accompanied them…<br><br>

«I wanted to ask you something, can you still receive the arrival rewards?»<br><br>

A question regarding the status of the exception that was me, the only one who was considered half-retired.<br><br>

It probably wasn’t the only reason he came here to me.<br><br>

I will consider it the appetiser before moving on to the main dish.<br><br>

«I’m glad to say I’m still being recognised for that as it wasn’t my intention to retire after all.»<br><br>

Thanks to that, Ichinose-san and Shibata-kun are properly able to receive the arrival rewards.<br><br>

It’s lower than the other top groups naturally, but that can’t be helped.<br><br>

«By the way, what affairs do you have for coming to the starting spot today, may I ask?»<br><br>

«One of them was a waste of effort in the end.»<br><br>

He replied as he gazed out towards the sea at the task now taking place.<br><br>

«The last spot was unfortunately taken by Kouenji already.»<br><br>

That’s regrettable. I would have used my binoculars to spectate if he was participating.<br><br>

Kouenji’s performances was just a pain for us however.<br><br>

Even if I left my personal feelings out, I still would have liked to see Ayanokouji-kun do the honours instead.<br><br>

«He was 4th in the morning, but now he’s in 2nd place it seems. He really is the Wunderkind of Class 2-D if I may say so.»<br><br>

«We share the same opinion then.»<br><br>

Kouenji-kun’s talent is unlimited. Ayanokouji-kun is probably feeling the weight of it directly on his skin.<br><br>

The fact Nanase-san isn’t by him now means there was an empty spot for the girls’ side.<br><br>

«It should take about 30 mins before the task is over and Nanase-san comes back. Please take a seat. It’s rather refreshing here in the shade.»<br><br>

It wasn’t a suitable place to entertain guests, but letting him stand there in the sun won’t do.<br><br>

«How did you know about Nanase?»<br><br>

«I regularly receive information from all over the island.»<br><br>

The main group has a transceiver which I use to contact them. <br><br>

As someone who can’t move her legs, it’s a necessary tool to process information, don’t you think?<br><br>

«Is that okay with you? I’m your enemy you know?»<br><br>

«Fufu, I don’t mind.»<br><br>

Ayanokouji-kun is not in the top 10 as of now. He could still be included in another group later and become a terrifying enemy later, but moving up as soloer is difficult. Furthermore, the amount of damage he has taken from fatigue is hard to guess.<br><br>

If so, being close to him makes it all more enjoyable am I right?<br><br>

It’s almost impossible to make time to be alone with him at the school. No need to concern ourselves with others. No need to think too much.<br><br>

The fact that he doesn’t seem to share that sentiment is a pity.<br><br>

While my heart is racing thinking about the conversation we are about to have…<br><br>

I always end up wishing it could last forever. Even for just a moment longer.<br><br>
