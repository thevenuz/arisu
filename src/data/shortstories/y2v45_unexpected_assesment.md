I stood up after seeing Ayanokouji-kun returning back inside the ship, escaping the eyes of the 3rd year students.<br><br>

Showing himself here has to be a coincidence I think, but that’s also why it was the perfect opportunity to meet each other as well.<br><br>

But before leaving the scene, I moved my attention to Nanase Tsubasa.<br><br>

There was a chance there were students from the White Room among the 1st year students, but it seems I can remove her from the list. Ayanokouji-kun seems to trust her as well.<br><br>

Or, fufu. Though the word trust is overselling it.<br><br>

Taking the White Room’s environment into account, there is no way Ayanokouji-kun has anything close to those feelings.<br><br>

Whether she was a White Room student or not, just leaving her close by wouldn’t be a hindrance, he probably thinks. That’s all there is to it.<br><br>

And in order to get information about the 1st year students, it was a fact you had to get intimate with one.<br><br>

In that sense, Nanase-san was a crucial piece for him. <br><br>

Right before passing by her, I checked her figure again.<br><br>

I could see that she didn’t put her high stats in athleticism in the OAA app to shame with her toned arms and legs.<br><br>

Those parts representing her femininity were well developed and based on her sitting posture, she must have had a good upbringing.<br><br>

“Maybe that is why boys would want to keep her close by, rather than due to her abilities.”<br><br>

Then I took a peek at her lunch.<br><br>

A sandwich and a carton of milk.<br><br>

It was a balanced, light and quick meal. A good choice.<br><br>

You wouldn’t think she was a first year student from looking at her body and how little she ate.<br><br>

As I figured, she wasn’t just talented in school, but was also blessed with a body from birth.<br><br>

“You’d better treasure those talents of yours.”<br><br>

Even though so many want to be talented, that they had Nanase’s body proportions, to many girls, that would be a wish that would never be fulfilled.<br><br>

…. My thoughts ended up drifting off in a strange direction. How unlike me.<br><br>

“Well, let’s chase after Ayanokouji-kun now then.”<br><br>

Based on this situation, I could more or less guess where he had to be now.<br><br>

Even if I, for some unlikely reason read it wrongly, finding him on this ship itself wouldn’t be so hard if I just made some calls.<br><br>

I had my own kind of weapons.<br><br>

In order to get Ayanokouji-kun to become my opponent, this was nothing but a minor inconvenience in the end.<br><br>
