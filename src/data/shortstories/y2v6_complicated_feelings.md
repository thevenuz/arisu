I was having a good time chatting with Ayanokouji-kun who excused himself from joining the sport festival and was absent.<br><br>

I always had to be careful about what others until now, and today was the only chance I had where nobody could interfere.<br><br>

“You were just observing, but even made me come here and visit you. You are not planning on doing anything during the festival either, right? … I see.”<br><br>

I pieced together all the scattered hints he had been giving me during our conversation.<br><br>

“In other words—Eh”<br><br>

Suddenly, he gently grabbed my shoulders and pushed me back.<br><br>

Usually, this amount of strength was nothing to most people, but since my body was rather weak and I hadn’t expected it, I fell backwards in a daze.<br><br>

It didn’t hurt of course. I just fell back from where I sat on the bed.<br><br>

I should have been seeing his face right now, but my eyes were spinning while looking at the ceiling.<br><br>

Before I managed to sort out the situation, Ayanokouji-kun began mounting me.<br><br>

He had his hands on both sides of my head leaving me without any way to escape.<br><br>

“E-excuse me?”<br><br>

I didn’t look like he had succumbed to his primal desires.<br><br>

It should have been impossible, but somehow the possibility was within my calculations.<br><br>

My thoughts were all scrambled and that hindered me from coming to an answer.<br><br>

“My school life is founded on this plan I have. The fact you would come here today, would show interest in and eventually reach the answer as within possibility.”<br><br>

As if he were making fun of me, he reached his conclusion against this situation.<br><br>

“You will be hindrance if you told anyone else about this.”<br><br>

“You think I… would leak this?”<br><br>

I wasn’t so naïve that I didn’t understand how much of a bother that could be to him.<br><br>

I thought we both understood that…<br><br>

“The chances aren’t zero. You may try to blackmail me by saying you’d expose it unless I agreed to have a match with you. I’d have no other options in that case.”<br><br>

“I see, that’s certainly true… But, couldn’t I just reveal the truth about the White Room instead?”<br><br>

His true goal was hidden.<br><br>

That was definitely true, but I still haven’t managed to calm myself enough right now to think about it.<br><br>

While my mind was working, trying to calm down my thoughts, I continued to talk to him.<br><br>

“Shall we start the special lesson?”<br><br>

I saw his eyes as he muttered this and finally understood his goal.<br><br>

I couldn’t help but laugh, close my eyes and wait for the lesson.<br><br>

If this was his goal, I won’t mind.<br><br>

With these complicated feelings, I acknowledged that I would be used by him.<br><br>

But, do remember this, Ayanokouji-kun.<br><br>

If you are going to use me—I’m going to use you until the very end.<br><br>
